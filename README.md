
### Feature

As a user I want to be able to add a list of strings.
I want to see the number of vowels in each of the strings that I have entered.

### How to run

 Via Eclipse use the junit to runner in the test runnerfile in the feature folder running this will also provide a html report document in the target folder
 you can also run this by right clicking the feature file and selext  run as a "cucumber feature"

 - to verfify if the consontat function is working fine yuo can run "java com/exercise.Main "look","spoon"" in the terminal 



### suggestions

- throw an error instead of a null and catch the the error in the Main class (try catch etc) in the vowelcounter class
